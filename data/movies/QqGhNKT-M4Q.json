George Foreman is ten years younger and the heavyweight champion of the world. Promoter Don King wants to make a name for himself and offers both fighters five million dollars apiece to fight one another, and when they accept, King has only to come up with the money. He finds a willing backer in Mobutu Sese Suko, the dictator of Zaire, and the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" is set, including a musical festival featuring some of America's top black performers, like James Brown and B.B. King.","genres":[99],"mdb_id":10548,"original_title":"When We Were Kings","title":"When We Were Kings","backdrop":"/f6SSam3qrMz5y8Yrc0SqvWCpsQY.jpg","release_date":"1996-10-25","youtube_id":"QqGhNKT-M4Q","cast":["Muhammad Ali","George Foreman","Don King"],"directors":["Leon Gast"],"runtime":89,"imdbId":"tt0118147"}
