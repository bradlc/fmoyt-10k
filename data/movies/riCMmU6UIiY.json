{"poster":"/Aa9CSN16C5CLWQZ3iwAbGKmyA0s.jpg","overview":"It's Harold's birthday, and his closest friends throw him a party at Michael's apartment. Among Harold's presents is \"Cowboy\", since Harold may have trouble finding a cute young man on his own now that he's getting older. As the party progresses the self-deprecating humour of the group takes a nasty turn as the men become drunker. Climaxed by a cruel telephone \"game\" where each man must call someone and tell him (or her?) of his love for them.","genres":[18],"mdb_id":34377,"original_title":"The Boys in the Band","title":"The Boys in the Band","backdrop":"/hwZOU3LdND19IaTGhu47LWe8LLo.jpg","release_date":"1970-03-16","youtube_id":"riCMmU6UIiY","cast":["Leonard Frey","Frederick Combs","Cliff Gorman"],"directors":["William Friedkin"],"runtime":118,"imdbId":"tt0065488"}
