{"poster":"/90gUcjcGNAyYyhdSe1l9GqYkP3q.jpg","overview":"A data courier, literally carrying a data package inside his head, must deliver it before he dies from the burden or is killed by the Yakuza.  In a dystopian 2021, Johnny (Keanu Reeves) is a data trafficker who has an implant that allows him to securely store data too sensitive for regular computer networks. On one delivery run, he accepts a package that not only exceeds the implant's safety limits - and will kill him if the data is not removed in time - but also contains information far more important and valuable than he had ever imagined. On a race against time, he must avoid the assassins sent to kill him and remove the data before it, too, ends his life.","genres":[12,28,18,878,53],"mdb_id":9886,"original_title":"Johnny Mnemonic","title":"Johnny Mnemonic","backdrop":"/vNsGZPwf45rA3BrXEu8TVRwSqKF.jpg","release_date":"1995-05-26","youtube_id":"a9V7rz2Dg7g","cast":["Keanu Reeves","Dina Meyer","Takeshi Kitano"],"directors":["Robert Longo"],"runtime":97,"imdbId":"tt0113481"}
