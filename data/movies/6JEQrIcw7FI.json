{"poster":"/bNo0TuLYEpee0LEB4GHFQgG7yvN.jpg","overview":"Koch Brothers Exposed is a hard-hitting investigation of the 1% at its very worst. This full-length documentary film on Charles and David Koch—two of the world’s richest and most powerful men—is the latest from acclaimed director Robert Greenwald (Wal-Mart: the High Cost of Low Price, Outfoxed, Rethink Afghanistan). The billionaire brothers bankroll a vast network of organizations that work to undermine the interests of the 99% on issues ranging from Social Security to the environment to civil rights. This film uncovers the Kochs’ corruption—and points the way to how Americans can reclaim their democracy.","genres":[99],"mdb_id":100813,"original_title":"Koch Brothers Exposed","title":"Koch Brothers Exposed","backdrop":"/5S7ZBjIeiG0xtPyG253kegBt7HV.jpg","release_date":"2012-03-07","youtube_id":"6JEQrIcw7FI","cast":["Bernie Sanders","Van Jones","Bill McKibben"],"directors":["Robert Greenwald"],"runtime":55,"imdbId":"tt2347411"}
