Like all of the inhabitants of this carefully controlled environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to the \"The Island\" - reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet. But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie. He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones. Lincoln makes a daring escape with a beautiful fellow resident named Jordan Two-Delta. Relentlessly pursued by the forces of the sinister institute that once housed them, Lincoln and Jordan engage in a race for their lives to literally meet their makers.","genres":[28,53,878,12],"mdb_id":1635,"original_title":"The Island","title":"The Island","backdrop":"/7gckgf6lmlKsjtkmS8O0oT3iEev.jpg","release_date":"2005-07-20","youtube_id":"JYOnQ2kgxQM","cast":["Ewan McGregor","Scarlett Johansson","Djimon Hounsou"],"directors":["Michael Bay"],"runtime":136,"imdbId":"tt0399201"}
