Was it brilliance? Was it cheating? And how did he do it? \"Press Your Luck's\" host and crew, the family of Michael Larson - the man who walked away with $110,237 in cash and prizes - and Michael's opponents from that fateful day gathered in Hollywood 19 years later to relive the events of that remarkable event in TV history.","genres":[99],"mdb_id":117033,"original_title":"Big Bucks : The Press Your Luck Scandal","title":"Big Bucks : The Press Your Luck Scandal","backdrop":null,"release_date":"2003-03-16","youtube_id":"nzNMCXWCZzQ","cast":["Peter Tomarken"],"directors":[],"runtime":83,"imdbId":"tt0353238"}
