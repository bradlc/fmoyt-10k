{"poster":"/qV7QaSf7f7yC2lc985zfyOJIAIN.jpg","overview":"A fast paced comedy about a card sharp and his unwillingly enlisted friends, who need to make a lot of cash quick after losing a sketchy poker match. To do this they decide to pull a heist on a small-time gang who happen to be operating out of the flat next door. Lots of British humor, off the wall characters, and a line up of unbelievable scenes put director Guy Ritchie on the map.","genres":[35,80],"mdb_id":100,"original_title":"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels","title":"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels","backdrop":"/kzeR7BA0htJ7BeI6QEUX3PVp39s.jpg","release_date":"1998-03-05","youtube_id":"v8oX8djhjgM"}
