{"poster":"/4x1j9lBbWXNhujjDUsDllOyxkaF.jpg","overview":"Director John Dullaghan’s biographical documentary about infamous poet Charles Bukowski, Bukowski: Born Into This, is as much a touching portrait of the author as it is an exposé of his sordid lifestyle.  Interspersed between ample vintage footage of Bukowski’s poetry readings are interviews with the poet’s fans including such legendary figures such as Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Joyce Fante (wife of John), Bono, and Harry Dean Stanton.  Filmed in grainy black and white by Bukowski’s friend, Taylor Hackford, due to lack of funding, the old films edited into this movie paint Bukowski’s life of boozing and brawling romantically, securing Bukowski’s legendary status.","genres":[99],"mdb_id":16765,"original_title":"Bukowski - Born into This","title":"Bukowski - Born into This","backdrop":"/fQtvwc4PPqsManpfgwuKvvDbWzz.jpg","release_date":"2003-01-18","youtube_id":"AuTJB3GbF80"}
